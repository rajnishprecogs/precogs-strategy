# Go-To-Market (GTM) Strategy for Precogs AI

## 1. Executive Summary
**Precogs AI** positions itself as a next-generation **AI-Powered DevSecOps & Compliance Platform**. By leveraging advanced AI (Gemini) for "Pre-cognitive" security analysis, it moves beyond traditional pattern matching to identify risks before they manifest.

**Core Value Proposition:**
*   **Predictive Security:** AI analysis of code intent and logic, not just syntax (SAST).
*   **Holistic Compliance:** Automatic SBOM generation and real-time compliance mapping (ISO, SOC2, GDPR) from a single scan.
*   **Developer-First:** Seamless integration into existing workflows (GitHub/GitLab) with actionable fix suggestions.

## 2. Target Audience Profiles (ICP)

| Persona | Pain Point | Value Prop |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CISO / CTO** | "I can't see my risk posture across 500 repos." | Dashboard visibility, automated compliance reporting, risk quantification. |
| **DevSecOps Lead** | "False positives are drowning my team." | AI-verified vulnerabilities reduce noise by 90%. |
| **Compliance Officer** | "Audit weeks are a nightmare." | One-click audit evidence generation and SBOM management. |
| **Developer** | "Security tools slow me down." | Instant inline fix suggestions in PRs; no context switching. |

## 3. Marketing & Distribution Channels

### A. Product-Led Growth (PLG) - *The "Bottom-Up" Motion*
*   **Free Tier for Open Source:** Allow individual developers to scan public repos for free. This builds brand awareness and user trust.
*   **GitHub Action / GitLab Component:** Frictionless adoption. a developer drops 2 lines of YAML into their pipeline and sees value immediately.

### B. Enterprise Sales - *The "Top-Down" Motion*
*   **Cloud Marketplaces (AWS, Azure):** Leverage existing enterprise cloud compute commits (EDP/MACC). CISO can buy Precogs AI using "use-it-or-lose-it" cloud budget.
*   **Channel Partners:** Partner with Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) who can resell Precogs AI to their clients.

### C. Content & Thought Leadership
*   **"The AI Security Gap":** Publish whitepapers on vulnerabilities that traditional SAST misses but AI catches.
*   **Vulnerability Database:** Host a searchable public database of vulnerabilities found in open source packages (similar to Snyk).

### D. Social Media Strategy
📱 **See full strategy:** [Social_Media_Strategy.md](./Social_Media_Strategy.md)

| Platform | Priority | Posting Frequency | Target Audience |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **X (Twitter)** | High | 2-3x/day | Developers, Security Researchers |
| **LinkedIn** | High | 5x/week | Enterprise buyers, CISOs, CTOs |
| **YouTube** | Medium | 4x/month | DevSecOps engineers seeking tutorials |
| **GitHub** | Medium | As needed | Open source community |

**Key Competitors Tracked:** Snyk (@snyksec), CodeRabbit, Aikido, Veracode, Checkmarx
